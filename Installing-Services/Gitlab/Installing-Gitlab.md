Sure, here's a guide for installing GitLab using Docker and Docker Compose:

# GitLab Installation via Docker

This guide will walk you through the process of installing GitLab using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are already installed on your system.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Create Directories for GitLab

Create directories for your GitLab setup and navigate into the desired directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /containers/gitlab/config
mkdir -p /containers/gitlab/logs
mkdir -p /containers/gitlab/data
cd /containers/gitlab
```

### Step 2: Create a Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file inside the `/containers/gitlab` directory with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  gitlab:
    image: gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest
    container_name: gitlab
    restart: always
    hostname: 'gitlab.example.com'
    environment:
      GITLAB_OMNIBUS_CONFIG: |
        external_url 'http://gitlab.example.com'
        gitlab_rails['gitlab_shell_ssh_port'] = 2222
    ports:
      - "8082:80"
      - "2222:22"
    volumes:
      - /containers/gitlab/config:/etc/gitlab
      - /containers/gitlab/logs:/var/log/gitlab
      - /containers/gitlab/data:/var/opt/gitlab
```

Adjust the `hostname` and `external_url` as needed as gitlab will use these for internal services.

### Step 3: Start the Containers

Run the following command to start the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will pull the necessary Docker images, create and start the containers in detached mode.

### Step 4: Access GitLab

Once the containers are up and running, you can access GitLab by navigating to `http://gitlab.example.com` in your web browser.

### Step 5: Complete the Setup

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the GitLab setup, including setting the initial root password.

## Summary

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional GitLab instance running via Docker. Your GitLab container will handle the web application, and the configuration, logs, and data will be stored in the specified directories.
