Sure, here's a guide for installing Mattermost using Docker and Docker Compose:

# Mattermost Installation via Docker

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Mattermost using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are already installed on your system.

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Step 1: Create Directories for Mattermost

Create directories for your Mattermost setup and navigate into the desired directory:

```bash
mkdir -p /containers/mattermost/data
mkdir -p /containers/mattermost/dbdata
cd /containers/mattermost
```

### Step 2: Create a Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file inside the `/containers/mattermost` directory with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  db:
    container_name: mattermost-db
    image: postgres:13
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - /containers/mattermost/dbdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: mmuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 3waf8z6q15rm
      POSTGRES_DB: mattermost

  app:
    container_name: mattermost-app
    image: mattermost/mattermost-team-edition:latest
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8083:8065"
    volumes:
      - /containers/mattermost/data:/mattermost/data
    environment:
      MM_SQLSETTINGS_DRIVERNAME: postgres
      MM_SQLSETTINGS_DATASOURCE: postgres://mmuser:3waf8z6q15rm@db:5432/mattermost?sslmode=disable
      MM_SERVICESETTINGS_SITEURL: http://localhost:8065
```

Adjust the environment variables (`POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DB`) as needed.

### Step 3: Start the Containers

Run the following command to start the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will pull the necessary Docker images, create and start the containers in detached mode.

### Step 4: Access Mattermost

Once the containers are up and running, you can access Mattermost by navigating to `http://localhost:8083` in your web browser.

### Step 5: Complete the Setup

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Mattermost setup.

## Summary

By following these steps, you should have a fully functional Mattermost instance running via Docker. Your PostgreSQL container will handle the database requirements.

Feel free to adjust any configurations as necessary to suit your environment and requirements.
