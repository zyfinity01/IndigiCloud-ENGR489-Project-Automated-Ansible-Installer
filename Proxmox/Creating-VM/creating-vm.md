# Custom Proxmox ISO Install Process

## Introduction


## Prerequisites


## Step 1: Downloading the ISO

In this case I will be using ubuntu 24.04.

Firstly I will download the Ubuntu server 24.04 ISO, this can be done be done by vising the ubuntu repository and either by downloading to you administration computer, or you can copy the URL of the download and paste it directly into your server so that you cut out the steps of wasting time and space on your administrative computer and directly send the ISO from ubuntu's server (in this case a mirror by 2degrees) directly to the proxmox install.
